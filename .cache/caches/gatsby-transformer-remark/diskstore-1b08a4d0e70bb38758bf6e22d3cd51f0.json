At just 1:30 min, the piece focuses on Ferri, the protagonist, clothed in a thick jumper and sitting in a red chair. You note every small detail as he clears his throat, shuts his eyes, opens them and looks left then right, before shutting them again. At this point, an extended finger from each hand is gradually brought from the periphery of the frame towards his face. The camera appeared to bob up and down slightly mirroring breathing. When Ferri opens his eyes, only the left is visible, the right obstructed from view by his finger. The work draws your attention to his features. Dealing with themes of alienation from the Western art world and the place of the peripheral artist, this piece provokes an interesting debate about the place of art separated from the Western cannon. Ferri’s art is introverted and fixed on the reality of the artist. I invested little time in watching, but gained a greater appreciation of his work after reading the artist’s statement.","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":262,"offset":1640},"end":{"line":12,"column":1238,"offset":2616}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1,"offset":1379},"end":{"line":12,"column":1238,"offset":2616}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"2.

During this black and white video we hear some of Wilke’s answerphone messages from family, friends, lovers and colleagues whilst Baroque music by Marcello then Vivaldi plays. Wilke is beautifully posed in each frame, reminding me of stills from Degas portraits, yet each image unfolds with the fluidity of a tragic dancer. Throughout the video Wilke undresses; during one moment she takes her sweater off, transforming into an amorphic blob of black, reminiscent of a nun’s headdress, but there is also a distinct sense of absence. Her clothes removed, the initials and names of the people in the messages are revealed across her torso and breasts, and she removes these until all traces have disappeared. The video evokes both sadness and sexuality. Sat in a dark alcove of the warehouse, wearing headphones and listening to private messages, whilst watching Wilke undress, gave a voyeuristic frissant to the experience of this piece. You are both distanced from and intimate with the scene. Erotic and sensual, sad and haunting, it is ambiguous and complex. A beautiful use of light and shadow and the use of the body to form fluid changing shapes made this a captivating piece to watch.","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":125,"offset":2909},"end":{"line":18,"column":1384,"offset":4168}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1,"offset":2785},"end":{"line":18,"column":1384,"offset":4168}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"3.

Based on a medieval torture device, the heads of 12 people are inserted into what looks like a seaside picture board from the front. However, the holes through which the heads poke through don’t impose their faces onto a comedy figure, but rather creates the image of disembodied heads hanging in a misty and eerie forest. The camera slowly rotates around accompanied by a grinding sound simulating heavy cogs turning. The back of the image becomes visible and you see 12 figures arranged on a wooden structure. All in varying degrees of dress (some are in shorts, others have naked bottoms) the human forms arranged on the unadorned wooden stand appear very sculptural. There is something playful, reassuring and slightly comical after the eerie forest scene, yet there are still dark undertones. Heads and bodies exist on two different sides of the structure calling to attention the divide between the real and the imaginary. As the camera rotates again, accompanied by the low grinding, the image returns to the surreal forest of disembodied heads. This piece reminded me of renaissance paintings of hell. Interestingly, the structure which this single channel loop is projected on is the same from behind as the one used in the video, further blurring the boundary between the real and the imagined.","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":127,"offset":4423},"end":{"line":24,"column":1433,"offset":5729}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1,"offset":4297},"end":{"line":24,"column":1433,"offset":5729}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"4.

This piece plays with darkness and light, abstraction and representation. Standing in a darkened room, music by J.B Krumpholz plays whilst different performances are displayed across 5 TV screens. Sometimes the performers were dark figures on a phosphorescent background, other times various body parts of the performers were phosphorescent and set against a dark background. Phosphorescent shapes shift and rearrange on each screen creating a ballet of moving shapes. Alone in the darkness it made me want to dance along. This piece captivated me and I watched the 3:15 min work several times. As I moved through the fair the music followed, seeping through the rooms into some of the other works. After the fair, I was interested to discover a video of Herring discussing what he perceives to be generational shifts in our relationship to the camera, mortality and legacy, definitely well worth a watch.","position":{"start":{"line":36,"column":154,"offset":6654},"end":{"line":36,"column":1061,"offset":7561}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":36,"column":1,"offset":6501},"end":{"line":36,"column":1061,"offset":7561}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"6.

There are slight ripples moving across the lake, but the man has a clear, still reflection. You can hear the sounds of nature, birds chirrup and the sound of the water emanates. This piece was a meditative relief. I don’t know how long I sat just absorbing the scene, but it left me feeling completely relaxed. I began to worry less about what I might not see in the exhibition and feel more immersed in the present. The man in the lake turns gradually. There are sometimes ripples in the water, possibly fish. I felt as though I was looking at a landscape painting or photograph with a soundtrack. To me, this piece reflects the movement of the world, often unseen or gradual, but constant and continual. The chill of the building fitted with the sense of being outdoors amongst nature. The work seemed to cleanse my mind: Refreshed, I felt ready to embrace the next set of work. However, there was something very compelling about this piece which kept me looking back, even after I’d moved on.","position":{"start":{"line":72,"column":100,"offset":12815},"end":{"line":72,"column":1466,"offset":14181}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":72,"column":1,"offset":12716},"end":{"line":72,"column":1466,"offset":14181}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"12.

It explored the nature of memory through a series of videos which question what is real and what is imagined. The video shows people recalling a prominent memory from their youth. There are two adjacent colour screens, with sound and subtitles. On one screen you see the person recalling their memory, whilst on the other Jung recreates the scene, intending to show how memory can slip into fantasy or nostalgia. The human element is prevalent and I started to question whether or not it mattered if the memory was ‘real’? Human lives are fascinating. The correlation between the person talking and the recreated scene was seemingly abstract, yet beautiful.  Set next to Lamson’s work, the videos in this room felt more focused on the mind and the spirit than other sections of the exhibition.","position":{"start":{"line":78,"column":341,"offset":14644},"end":{"line":78,"column":1186,"offset":15489}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":78,"column":1,"offset":14304},"end":{"line":78,"column":1186,"offset":15489}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"13.

It showed a series of photos after the caption of ‘Vesna’, with music playing in the background. The piece was developed in the search for a childhood friend of Rosalind Brodsky’s mother.

Although the original was never found, the video documents some of the alternatives.

Nagaoka produces pencils drawings on a single sheet of paper, drawing one image, erasing it and then drawing the next scene. This process is captured on camera, showing the movement of his hand and the pencil gliding across the paper.  The film is then edited into a rhythmical drawing animation.

Shaoxing created ink drawings of well-known scenes from history, put into a sequence of images. He states that his intention is not to reproduce history, but provide material for interpretation. Questions about both the original event, but also our representations of history are imbued in this piece. For Shaoxing, the historical images themselves are without interpretation, but of course the sequence and the music influence interpretation. On a superficial level, the superbly detailed ink images are fabulous to look at and as each image is from a moment in history it felt as though it was telling a story. On a deeper level the work serves to remind us of the impossibility of an accurate historical retelling, only the many versions and representations of the truth which create history.","position":{"start":{"line":96,"column":92,"offset":17657},"end":{"line":96,"column":920,"offset":18485}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":96,"column":1,"offset":17566},"end":{"line":96,"column":920,"offset":18485}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"16.
