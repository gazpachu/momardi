I guess you could say that in the Platonic sense, it was closer to the essence of the image rather than the mere reflection it produced, and this naturally felt important to me. There is an inherent permanence in the process of carving out an image or text into a surface that just doesn’t exist when making marks on a surface. For me it automatically conjures memories of seeing people’s initials carved in trees near where I grew up; they had this enchanting presence that I was fascinated by, as if they existed outside of our conventional understanding of time. I wanted to embody this sensation in my works, as if ironically doffing the cap towards the objecthood of Moses’ commandment stones or Joseph Smith’s gold tablets.

Most families I have visited in Romania, regardless of how religious they are, have icons of saints in their homes. Whether bought by relatives or painted in an art class, it wasn’t important to me how they came to be there, but rather how their nature defined them as cherished objects.

After ruling out a number of hypotheses, the pair found pigeon droppings inside the horn and they believed that this was the cause of the fuzzy sound they couldn’t get rid of. They cleaned out the ‘white dielectric material’ as they called it but were surprised to find that the noise persisted. They published their results, and it took another physicist – Robert H. Dicke – to identify this noise as the cosmic microwave background radiation leftover from the Big Bang, thus allowing astronomers to confirm the relatively new theory.

I enjoyed the challenge but it wasn’t a process that naturally yielded any consistency: Just because an idea is strong and coherent doesn’t mean that the product of it will be. That’s not to say that I am not interested in concept art – I really respect the work of Tom Friedman and Michael Landy for example – it’s just that this is a vehicle that my work isn’t suited to drive. The value of concept art should always be the concept itself rather than the material object and this seems to have become misunderstood since the rise of the YBA’s and works like Hirst’s A Thousand Years. Sol Lewitt wrote instructions of how to make a work of art so that anyone could make it, and this highlighted the fact that the value was in the idea, not in the material object that illustrated the idea. When I see so-called concept art being valued at blue-chip prices, I can’t help but think that the artist, the gallery, the collector or the whole lot of them are missing the point. This is why Michael Landy’s Break Down was a seminal work; it hits the nail directly on the head. I aim for what I guess you could call a holistic working method, where the process and the subject have a kind of symbiotic co-existence; the work would be flawed if one explicitly dominated the other.","position":{"start":{"line":52,"column":1,"offset":10392},"end":{"line":52,"column":1594,"offset":11985}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":52,"column":1,"offset":10392},"end":{"line":52,"column":1594,"offset":11985}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"raw","value":"\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/e01cc91ff3f5df587b5b102b9bd320dd/7cc5e/On-the-movement-of-pieces-eating-each-other_zahax2.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 480px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 124%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"On the movement of pieces eating each other zahax2\"\n        title=\"On the movement of pieces eating each other\"\n        src=\"/static/e01cc91ff3f5df587b5b102b9bd320dd/7cc5e/On-the-movement-of-pieces-eating-each-other_zahax2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e01cc91ff3f5df587b5b102b9bd320dd/e07e9/On-the-movement-of-pieces-eating-each-other_zahax2.jpg 200w,\n/static/e01cc91ff3f5df587b5b102b9bd320dd/066f9/On-the-movement-of-pieces-eating-each-other_zahax2.jpg 400w,\n/static/e01cc91ff3f5df587b5b102b9bd320dd/7cc5e/On-the-movement-of-pieces-eating-each-other_zahax2.jpg 480w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n  <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">On the movement of pieces eating each other</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n      ","position":{"start":{"line":54,"column":1,"offset":11987},"end":{"line":54,"column":115,"offset":12101}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":54,"column":1,"offset":11987},"end":{"line":54,"column":115,"offset":12101}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"6.

I’ve always thought it would be great to write a sit-com about a group of artists sharing a studio, sharing really esoteric jokes like welcoming each guest with the question “do you Badiou?”, or holding relational aesthetic drinking games…but then I think that would be pretty niche to say the least. This all sounds like I have a cynical view of art education, which is not the case, my point is that it is not by any means, the be all and end all, and won’t make an artist out of someone that isn’t suited to be one.","position":{"start":{"line":60,"column":1,"offset":12871},"end":{"line":60,"column":1581,"offset":14451}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":60,"column":1,"offset":12871},"end":{"line":60,"column":1581,"offset":14451}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"With regards to the financial climate, I honestly don’t think that the current economic challenges should feature in the decision of whether or not to study art, and I want to emphasise that this opinion comes from the point of view of someone who worked in supermarkets, pubs and galleries to fund their education, without the guarantee of a prosperous career after it.
