Witnesses said that thousands marched down Zubairy Street, a main city thoroughfare, and were fired on when they reached a government checkpoint near the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Some demonstrators retreated, others carried on and were shot at again. At least 12 people were killed and some 30 injured. Ms Qaws—who was herself involved in resistance to the regime—found her son after a second visit to look for him, among the wounded at a mosque that was being used as a temporary field hospital. Zayed remained in a coma for two days after the incident. He was injured on two further occasions, as demonstrations continued. On 23 November, President Saleh flew to Saudi Arabia, and signed an agreement transferring power to his deputy, Abdurabu Mansur Hadi.

Eventually, at 18.00 on 11 February, Vice-President Suleiman announced that Mubarak had resigned, handing leadership over to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces.

The location falls within the Russkaya Arktika National Park, covering more than 46,000 square kilometers of islands and sea in the Arctic Ocean, one of the largest protected areas in the northern hemisphere. A polar bear’s primary prey is the seal, the blubber satisfying the bear’s enormous energy needs. Bears hunt seals from sea-ice platforms, and also use ice floes to move from place to place. In summer months, when much sea ice melts, polar bears can become stranded, and have to forage for what food they can. Their dependence on sea-ice platforms for food, traveling, and also for breeding, makes polar bears vulnerable to the effects of climate warming. In 2011, the volume of Arctic sea ice was 66 percent lower than the average documented from 1979 through 2010.","position":{"start":{"line":50,"column":1,"offset":9986},"end":{"line":50,"column":993,"offset":10978},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":50,"column":1,"offset":9986},"end":{"line":50,"column":993,"offset":10978},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"html","title":"1st prize Nature Stories.

Authorities are often bribed, or turn a blind eye to illegal trade in, and use of rhino horn. Ground rhino horn is used primarily as an anti-fever and anti-toxin medication, in practices that go back centuries. In Vietnam, where a senior government minister has claimed that rhino horn cured his cancer, it sells for €1,865 per 100g to local customers, and for over €6,340 to foreign buyers. With rhinoceros horn worth more than gold, the animals are the target of poachers. South Africa alone lost over 400 rhinos to illegal poaching in 2011.

The shootings formed the second of two sequential attacks, the first being a car-bomb explosion in the government quarter of the capital, which killed eight people and injured 92. The Utøya incident took place less than two hours later. The island is the site of an annual summer camp organized by the youth division of the Norwegian Labor Party. Breivik gained access by posing as a police officer who had come to conduct a routine check following the Oslo bombing. He went on to shoot indiscriminately, killing and injuring people around the island and firing on those who jumped into the water in an attempt to escape.","position":{"start":{"line":78,"column":1,"offset":17065},"end":{"line":78,"column":789,"offset":17853},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":78,"column":1,"offset":17065},"end":{"line":78,"column":789,"offset":17853},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Local police did not have a helicopter appropriate for transporting groups of officers, and could not find a suitable boat to reach the island.
