I’ve decided not to jump on the bandwagon and just leave <em>that</em> discussion to the art experts and the critics. <strong>It also doesn’t really matter to me if people accuse him of being just a brand than an artist</strong>. Time will tell whether the sharks, the diamond skulls and the golden calves in formaldehyde would withstand the hype of the present and would be something people of the future would queue all day for, the same way we do now for example, to see works of masters like Leonardo da Vinci.</p>\n<p>Behind all this no-care-for-the-world musings, this didn’t stop me from going to the opening at the <a href=\"https://www.othercriteria.com/\">Other Criteria</a> gallery in the beginning of January hoping to meet the man. <strong>I’d be a hypocrite if I say, I wouldn’t be starstruck</strong>. He is after all, Damien Hirst, the richest living British artist and one who can command just about £1 million for a spot painting. <strong>It is depressing to know that I could create circles all day and still nobody will give me a penny</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 78.90625%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 2em\" > <iframe allowfullscreen class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/E3xGwgmkR1M?wmode=transparent&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;rel=0&amp;theme=dark&amp;feature=plcpcontext=C3750c4fUDOEgsToPDskLsZETEPpgBbouBP8NKu5CV\" title=\"YouTube video player\" type=\"text/html\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<figcaption>Opening at Damien Hirst’s Spot Paintings at the Other Criteria Gallery. Music by [darksidewarrior](http://www.soundclouc.com/darksidewarrior)</figcaption>\n<p>And probably – aside from the audacity of his past works – <strong>Damien Hirst’s other great contribution to art is creating the status for super rich and bankable artists, making art suddenly an important and viable profession</strong>. Becoming an artist has suddenly become not just for the creatively passionate, but a real trade where business and strategy are part of the game.</p>\n<p>In my mind, Damien Hirst knows how to make art that stirs discussion but also stirs the pockets.</p>\n<p>And whether he is a great artist or not, the fact that people have strong opinions about Damien’s art is an indication of his ingenuity. When I saw his spot paintings at Other Criteria and also at the Gagosian in Britannia Street, I forgot all the brouhaha about his assistants doing the leg work for his paintings. <strong>What I really wanted to know was what drove him to suddenly abandon his preoccupation with death and immortality and jump to the joy of painting circles</strong>. </p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d772b9affa7cda4052a547d4929ff325/c08c5/P1040061_pykah0.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"P1040061 pykah0\"\n        title=\"Opening at the Other Criteria Gallery (January 2012)\"\n        src=\"/static/d772b9affa7cda4052a547d4929ff325/c08c5/P1040061_pykah0.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d772b9affa7cda4052a547d4929ff325/e07e9/P1040061_pykah0.jpg 200w,\n/static/d772b9affa7cda4052a547d4929ff325/066f9/P1040061_pykah0.jpg 400w,\n/static/d772b9affa7cda4052a547d4929ff325/c08c5/P1040061_pykah0.jpg 640w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n  <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Opening at the Other Criteria Gallery (January 2012)</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n      </p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/7f85a84f49552630b4ce2048ca18a68d/c08c5/spotpaintings2_d8upee.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"spotpaintings2 d8upee\"\n        title=\"My picture at the Gagosian Gallery.
