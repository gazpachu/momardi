Hi, I am Tuesday!

In 2012, I had the privilege to work with the best art practitioners in the country for the **London 2012 Festival – the largest UK-wide festival ever staged**. As the digital manager for the culture team, we were able to deliver more than 12,000 events attended by more than **20 million people around the UK** in celebration of the [Olympic and Paralympic Games](http://www.london2012.com).
