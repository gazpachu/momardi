Hi, I am Tuesday. Welcome to my art blog!

Two years ago, I had the privilege to work with the best art practitioners in the country for the **London 2012 Festival – the largest UK-wide  festival ever staged**. As the digital manager for the culture team, we were able to deliver more than 12,000 events attended by more than **20 million people around the UK** in celebration of the [Olympic and Paralympic Games](http://www.london2012.com). Watch the highlights of the Festival at [TheSpace](http://thespace.org/items/p0001f60)

**About the blog**

I’ve created Momardi as a way of educating myself about the arts and creative sector. Through this blog, **I want to promote artists I like and also feature the latest art exhibitions around London and occasionally some international exhibits.**

I am an all-around digital professional with years of experience in content creation, content strategy and social media. [View my curriculum at LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/tuesdaygutz)
