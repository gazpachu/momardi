I had been feeling rather sleepy lately. And I had been doubling my caffeine intake to battle the drowsiness but unfortunately coffee in London is a bit too light for my taste. I prefer strong *Spanish cortado* which gives you a quick punch on the face jabbing to say **Despiertate!**

Uhm, I miss the food and the sun in Spain but after reading Adriane Searle´s article about [The Drain in Spain: the country´s art crisis](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/27/new-europe-spain-arts-cuts "Drain in spain") in the Guardian, I can´t help but nod at my decision to leave the sunny shores of Alicante to be here. **They are all leaving**, I thought. I will learn more about art here. But I am still sleepppy.

Spending time in the art library without anyone to talk to does not help so I thought of changing my routine for the day.

I decided to take a break from sending CVs today too and blogging at another site,  and you know what a relief that is!) I need to get the blood circulation moving to wake up so I decided to swing by **New Bond street** to check out **[The Opera Gallery](http://www.operagallery.com/ "The Opera Gallery")**.

Apparently, The Opera Gallery is really an important gallery and they have offices in New York, Paris, Seoul, Singapore. Backpack was heavy together with my head but I pranced along. The door of the gallery was open and I noticed workers were coming in and out with a new set of paintings. **This must be a new installation and I am feeling lucky today**.

Before I went in, I took a photo of graffitti art of **The Queen** near the gallery door. I love the fact that the symbol of the Royal Highness is still relevant in art and more so because of the up-coming hoopla of a wedding.

Predictably inside, there´s another graffitti art painting of **William and Kate** by Mr. Brainwash, an important graffitti artist. With galleries now works like these, this is a testament to how graffitti art have creeped into contemporary consciousness.

Two years ago, while I was in Paris, there was a huge exhibit for graffitti artists which included **Jonone**, a famous American artist living now in Paris.

*This looks like its from Mr. Brainwash*

Heading home, and checking the internet for Brainwash, I learned that Banksy created a film about him so tonight I would definitely try to see that movie and will let you know what I think. Strangely, browsing Flickr for more photos, I stumbled upon **artisthecure's photostream** and found pictures of the opening of the graffiti exhibit at the Opera Gallery.

Hmmm, I discovered that The Queen graffitti art and William and Kate´s are not by Mr Brainwash but from another artist named **Rich Simmons** who seems to be also the founder of **[Art is The Cure](http://www.facebook.com/artisthecureofficial?sk=app_106966931352 "Art is the Cure")** which promotes art therapy as a movement to save lives. He just added me on Facebook and I hope to score an interview and see if I can join their art street teams around the city. Check out the video below. Sorry if it's in French but his interview is in English...
