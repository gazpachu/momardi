The inauguration of Ai Weiwei´s sculpture installation (Circle of animals/Zodiac heads) in New York has just been bumped off following the death of Osama bin laden. I hope **Ai Weiwei** will not become yesterday´s news just because everyone is anticipating OBL´s death photo. The death of a mastermind terrorist is probably CNN´s top money-making headline of the moment but the death of freedom of expression – which Weiwei now symbolizes – is equally important. **30 days have passed and still no word of Weiwei´s whereabouts.**

Last weekend, **British artist Hamish Fulton** staged a slowalking performance at Tate with the help of 100 volunteers in support of Ai Weiwei.

**[Charlotte Eater](http://www.expressandstar.com/uk/uk-news/2011/05/02/woman-bares-all-for-detained-artist/ "Charlotte Eater")**, 32, a laughter yoga teacher from North London, painted the words “Thank you Ai Wei wei” and freedom over her body before deciding to walk across Weiwei´s sunflower installation at the Tate, barenaked. Some Tate staff members saw her but nobody stopped her. Somebody even shouted bravo.

In Hongkong, [hundreds of protestors](http://english.ntdtv.com/ntdtv_en/news_china/2011-05-03/chair-protest-supporters-demand-ai-weiwei-s-release-.html "chair protest") have demanded the release of Ai Weiwei by using chairs to form the word prison, echoing Ai Weiwei´s Ming and Qing chair installation in Germany in 2007.
