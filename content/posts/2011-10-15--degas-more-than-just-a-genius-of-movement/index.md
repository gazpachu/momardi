It is hard to imagine a world without Monet and his water lilies, and so much more without **Edgar Degas and his ballerinas**. Ever since I saw Degas’ works at the [Musee d’ Orsay](http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/home.html "Musee d'Orsay"), I was introduced to a **fascinating behind-the-scenes world of ballet dancers**, which were more interesting than the actual spectacle.  

Clearly, **ballet was the domain of Edgar Degas**, who was known to be a fixture of the Paris Opera in the late 19th century in his attempt to capture movement and beauty. But in this exhibit at the [Royal Academy of Art](http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/degas/about-the-exhibition/ "Royal academy of art: Degas"), there was so much more about Degas that I didn’t know. I expected only to be bombarded by images of ballerinas, but **the exhibit also focused on his creative process and his experimentation with the technological advances** of his time.

**The genius of Degas is of course his way of capturing special and unguarded moments.** Just look at the many images of ballet dancers slumped in a corner or when they are just in repose such as in the **Dance Lesson and the Dance rehearsal**. He captured this essence of spontaneity but **framed the scenes asymmetrically allowing us an experience of seeing it mid-scene**. The composition of his paintings made me wonder whether he was sketching or fiddling with an advanced camera with a fantastic element of depth of field to record these scenes before actually painting them.

**He was obsessed with human figure movement and choreography**. Degas, however, couldn’t find alliance with his Impressionists friends to share this new passion except for the photographers which eventually led him to photography. There were **three photographs he shot of three ballet dancers** which showed his interest in lighting effects. There was also a photo of a woman in a bathtub which was the inspiration for the famous bathtub painting.

The exhibit even went so far as including a clip **(Serpentine Dance) from the Lumiere brothers** and displaying items such as plate cameras which were a novelty during that time. **Ann Dumas**, curator of the Royal Academy of Art said these films were frequently shown in Montmarte and Degas would have certainly known about them.

**The fantastic array of sketches included in the show also demonstrated his dedication of studying movement**. With photography as his new ally, he pushed boundaries in his art and translated himself in a variety of medium – oil painting, pastels and sculpture.

The only sculpture he exhibited during his lifetime, the Little Dancer was a central piece of the show. The way people inspected the **Little Dancer** in the exhibit, **I forgot how much this sculpture had been criticized and called ugly and a monkey**. There were a whole lot more of figurative sculptures in the room, and I wonder if the criticism on Little Dancer led him to practice sculpture privately. The exhibit ends with a short clip of **Degas captured in film**, walking in Paris with a lady.
