Artist [Noemi Lakmaier](http://www.noemilakmaier.co.uk/) is sitting in one desk and one-by-one painting shoes in blue road-marking paint, the colour of paint used for disabled badge holder’s parking bays. **Her goal is to individually paint more than 500 shoes** for ‘The Observer Effect’,  one of the many sculptural pieces and installations for the new Pop Up Gallery at [Shape Arts](http://www.shapearts.org.uk/).

A cultural institution that develops opportunities for disabled artists, **Shape Arts has transformed its 60,000 square foot contemporary space to accommodate more than 130 artworks by 30 artists**. The show will be running until 30 May 2013 so please be sure to check it out. I am especially excited to see[ James Lake’s](http://www.jameslakesculpture.co.uk/) ‘Sitting without a purpose’ cardboard sculpture! I will update the blog next week when I have more pictures to share.

**Shape CEO Tony Heaton said: ‘This is a new initiative for Shape and a fantastic opportunity to show the work of some of Britain’s most talented disabled artists working today** – we also want to invite the city to come in and enjoy some lunchtime culture! And… if you are looking for some different shoes we have them… Come over and see us, you will be very welcome.’
