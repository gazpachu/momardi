**Let there be light!** Last Tuesday, I attended the press preview of [Hayward Gallery’s new Light show](www.haywardlightshow.co.uk/) and was left bedazzled by the possibilities of light-based art. With more than** 25 illuminated installations and sculptures by major international artists**,  it can literally be light-changing especially if you see **Olafur Eliasson’**s *Model for a timeless garden (2011)* – my favourite among the entire show. I suggest that you see this piece last if you want to have the best enlightened experience.

The whole show is dazzling in so many ways: **It is truly a homage to light and its power to change our perception**. The artists who have participated in the show have long been purveyors of light even as early as the sixties. But here they do not only explore light as a spatial and environmental experience, they also provide us with a big techie-geeky showmanship. By marrying the art of the light form with technology, we experience some **radioactive psychedelic transcendence** where we end up getting light years away high without the paraphernalia.  Expect this show to not only will  mess with your senses, but also get ready for some form of eureka moment. **Don’t blink.**
