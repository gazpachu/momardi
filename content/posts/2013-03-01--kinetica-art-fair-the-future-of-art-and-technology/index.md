The more our lives become intertwined with technology, the more the [Kinetica Art Fair](http://www.kinetica-artfair.com/) becomes a relevant platform for ambitious tech-related type of art. Now on its fifth year, **Kinetica Art Fair is bustling with energy and possibilities.** The great thing about the Kinetic Art Fair is that it looks to the future and yes, it’s future is oh so bright.  I predict that in a few years to come, it will become a much more important exhibition and would garner more funding from not just new media outfits but also by top art ponchos.

A convergence of kinetic, electronic, robotic, sound, light, time-based and multi-disciplinary new media art, Kinetica Art Fair brings artworks from more than **35 galleries and some of the artists featured are with international pedigree**. It’s not surprising that this is not a curated art fair.  Art is for all and so is technology although I am sure that if it is curated better, it can be a formidable force in the arts world. But for now, here in the Kinetica Art Fair, there is a sense of **<span style="color: #000000;">collaborative spirit all happening between artists, designers, architects and new media students</span>** so much so that it seems like they are breeding this into their own playground.

Interactivity is in the heart of the Kinetica Art Fair: from a typewriter that beats drum sounds into bottles to a large-scale sculptural zoetrope, there are unexpected things in this exhibition that can take your breath away.

**1. A sculptural dream-world**
