[Art 13](http://artfairslondon.com/) – the new contemporary art fair that graced London this week was a success: Artinfo reports the **positive sales** incurred during the show and it signals a bright future for this art newcomer. For me, despite not seeing the presence of major London galleries here, what I really enjoyed most was discovering foreign galleries and seeing Oriental artists take centre stage (if they haven’t been basking in the Art limelight already).

The great thing about these (South east) Asian artists is their new found confidence and their boldness in merging both **tradition and Western ideals in their artwork**. It’s not anything new of course – a lot of artists explore their history to create a new language in their work. But personally, (and possibly with a lot of bias), I am drawn to the ingenuity and the new energy that these artists bring.

**The Boat – a monumental rice paper sculpture by Chinese artist Zhu Jhinsi** was, in my opinion, the most audacious piece of art in the fair. But aside from the stunning artworks from these Oriental artists, overall Art 13 is truly Europe’s global art fair. With more than 129 art galleries from 29 countries, it might be too much to take in. (How do critics do it?) –  my small self can only pick a few favourites.
