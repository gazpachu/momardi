## Social/Multimedia Content Specialist

I was part of the in-house content team within Global communications, and we were responsible for producing content in the form of articles, videos, and social media to support the overall strategy of the business.

## Writer

As a writer, I produced articles for Unilever's sustainability agenda for both internal and external channels. **I  was the main writer for the internal bi-weekly column called 'In brief'** featuring stories about brands and their milestones in sustainability. I collaborated with communications department heads, brand managers and other major stakeholders to find the best stories for the column.

## Video Production

I was also part of the internal video production team **responsible for filming high quality videos for the CEO office**. As part of the communications, we filmed communications and messaging from the CEO on topics ranging from sustainability campaigns, year end report and other major announcements.

Our team were commissioned to film in the Unilever offices and we **edited more than 200 videos** for internal use. We were using Final Cut Pro as the editor application and I acted as an assistant director helping setup and organise the shooting.

We were also producing content for various departments within corporate comms especially for the Unilever Foundation team and the campaigns team, and also for other functions such as HR, Supply Chain and IT. One of the main highlights of our collaboration was for the [Unilever Young entrepreneurs Awards](https://youngentrepreneursawards.unilever.com). It's an award for young leaders in sustainability who have created projects for their community.

For other major campaigns in corporate communications, I brainstormed with the video editor and the corresponding departments to commission high quality videos from external agencies.

## Social Media Strategy

I initiated and together with the Head of Content, **led a social media working group within Unilever**, bringing three major departments (corporate communications, HR, and brand team) to work together to ensure that a social media strategy were aligned. The remit was to ensure that were sharing stories and that we optimised our content via each other's platforms or where it is relevant.

For the media relations team, I helped craft the strategy for the twitter corp. channels and sourced stories around the business brand milestones.

To help the campaigns team with their sustainability campaigns and activations, I **crafted internal social strategies and content** via the [Chatter platform](https://www.salesforce.com/products/chatter/overview/) and also identified internal influencers within the business, sometimes acting as community manager during specific activations.

I also **created best practices strategy on email marketing and content distribution workflow** that optimises our content and maximises audience impact.
