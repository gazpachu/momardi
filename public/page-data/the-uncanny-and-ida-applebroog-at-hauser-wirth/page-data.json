The exhibit is a conglomeration of Ida´s career for the past 50 years.</p>\n<p><strong>The Marginalia series</strong> was sprawled all over the main gallery room. Just like Angela de la Cruz whose paintings have broken the realm of sculpture, <strong>Ida Applebroog´s paintings have propelled them into the dimension of room-sized installations</strong>. Canvasses of different sizes are stacked on top of each other, adjoined together, leaning against or protruding on the wall or on the floor. In an interview with Art21, Ida said: <strong>“When I work with canvasses, I work with three-dimensional structures. And the structure was as important as what it was I was painting.”</strong></p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/bfe33eb7acfe8407eb2bf279b271b5f7/b4294/ida1_r1juaf.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 43.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"ida1 r1juaf\"\n        title=\"Installation view, ‘Ida Applebroog’, Hauser & Wirth London, Savile Row. 2011 © Ida Applebroog.

Don´t we all just sometimes want to cross-over that border despite what people would say? A set shows a woman with two guns with another set in between her legs. There was also a set of two stacked canvasses of an image of a hairy man touching his chest and another set of a man growing roots and leaves. There were also individual paintings: A woman with spoon on her mouth eating with her feet, a child with a brace head, an image of a  baby on the floor, a dog with crutches climbing up the stairs, a woman filling her glass with water from a faucet that protrudes from her head – <strong>These all demonstrate Ida´s propensity to find dark humour on everyday scenes</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b68a4beb214667a838481ff29a12c381/b4294/ida3_pi5ykm.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"ida3 pi5ykm\"\n        title=\"Installation view, ‘Ida Applebroog’, Hauser & Wirth London, Savile Row. 2011 © Ida Applebroog.

These vaginal drawings were made since 1969 in her bathroom and I have never known an artist who has portrayed her crotch as intimately as Ida Applebroog. Back when she first created this, the word “vagina” was not even allowed to be uttered on national television. Still on so many parts of the world, it is still forbidden to explore that part of a woman´s identity. Looking at all the drawings, you get desensitized and realize the banality of gender. Hidden inside this house structure was a bloody red painting of a doll-figure with open legs and staring eyes.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/e3cdcb531bad354f21a48a25769ed306/b4294/ida5_jkmiyq.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 65.49999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMCBAX/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgP/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAdKCk53cECf/xAAZEAACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRIRP/2gAIAQEAAQUCum8FpJnRimf/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEf/aAAgBAwEBPwGI/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABL/2gAIAQIBAT8BpT//xAAYEAACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEQAhQf/aAAgBAQAGPwLC0Kn/xAAZEAADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhQXH/2gAIAQEAAT8hdCohubp4GzlWXejEsJH/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEFzv/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERIf/aAAgBAwEBPxCcG9w//8QAGBEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERIUH/2gAIAQIBAT8Q0JIs/8QAGRABAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREAITFB/9oACAEBAAE/EKwAMj8ws+UV9xApUZzGjD0vckQIHiblAeyb/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"ida5 jkmiyq\"\n        title=\"Installation view, ‘Ida Applebroog’, Hauser & Wirth London, Savile Row. 2011 © Ida Applebroog.
