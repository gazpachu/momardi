December had been a very busy month for blogging but now I’m back, feeling refreshed and optimistic about this year</strong>. This 2012 is going to be an exciting year for the creative sector in the UK as this summer there would be over 300 cultural events around the country. No need to fret about getting any cultural overdose! I will bask in the sunshine of culture, culture, culture – a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I am so happy to be here. Woot!</p>\n<p><strong>Personally, I am also excited also for this blog because it ‘s going to have its first birthday very soon in March</strong>. And I have so many aspirations for this blog this coming year. I want to interview more artists (established and emerging) and hopefully bring this to you via video. 2011 was a good time to establish the blog where I featured my own personal reviews about exhibitions and my favourite artists but I would like to share a little bit about myself this time. I am still applying for digital roles within the creative sector but would like to take some sculpture classes this year and a little bit of filmmaking short courses on the side and finally do something creative! Sky is the limit, baby.</p>\n<p>But I will of course continue reviewing  exhibits like the mind-blowing Chihuly show at the Halcyon gallery plus interviews with young artists. This Tuesday, I was confirmed to see the new <strong>Damien Hirst show at the Other Criteria</strong> gallery and might meet the man himself. If I could meet the guy who has put sharks in morphine and diamonds on skulls, nothing is impossible. <strong>Antony Gormley is next!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Happy New Year!</strong></p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/fireworks_g1lxm3-6fffe950676eea579e00011e48bd65b1-55fd7.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 78.28125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"fireworks g1lxm3\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/fireworks_g1lxm3-6fffe950676eea579e00011e48bd65b1-55fd7.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/fireworks_g1lxm3-6fffe950676eea579e00011e48bd65b1-e81c0.jpg 200w,\n/static/fireworks_g1lxm3-6fffe950676eea579e00011e48bd65b1-8e8ea.jpg 400w,\n/static/fireworks_g1lxm3-6fffe950676eea579e00011e48bd65b1-55fd7.jpg 640w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>","fields":{"slug":"/a-new-year/","prefix":"7 January 2012"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A New Year!","category":"personal","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/fireworks_g1lxm3-6fffe950676eea579e00011e48bd65b1-d927d.jpg"}}}}},"authornote":{"id":"6b2c6198-d5e1-5353-bb7b-a0bc41999229","html":"<p>Article by <strong>Tuesday Gutierrez</strong>.
