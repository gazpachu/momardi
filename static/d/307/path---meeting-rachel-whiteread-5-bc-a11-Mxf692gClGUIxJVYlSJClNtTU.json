Believe me, it’s something I would like to overcome because it doesn’t really serve me well. It doesn’t help that my cheeks get red and my tongue gets tied in front of a famous artist. Do you say ‘I’m your biggest fan’ as your opening line? How would anyone react to that? Instead of embarrassing myself, I just smile, stare and get red in one corner.</p>\n<p>In fact, I recognise that this is a result of <strong>being blinded by the newly celebrity status of artists today</strong>. It should be a conscious effort on my part to separate the ‘celebrity’ out of the artist and focus on how their art is speaking to me. Would I still like their art if they were not famous?

It is the act of deciding which gives that object a value</strong>. The interior of the house for example is something all of us have ignored just because it is there but Rachel decided it is as important as the house itself.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/rachel-whiteread-holocaust-memorial_wfnqa1-5a9e60fcc154683a7fe7c93cc25b36f4-55fd7.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; null; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 77.03125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"rachel whiteread holocaust memorial wfnqa1\"\n        title=\"Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial, 2000 by Rachel Whiteread.
