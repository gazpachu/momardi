Your Paintings is a joint initiative between the BBC and the charity Public Catalogue Foundation with the participation of  museums from across the UK. Most paintings on this site are part of a museum’s public collection that are not in public display at the moment (some are being repaired or conserved or being moved around for other exhibitions) so it’s a great way to familiarise yourself with paintings that you won’t probably see when visiting an actual museum. Your Paintings also includes <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/guidedtours\">guided tours </a>from not just artists, art critics or experts but also by a more diverse bunch of people like actress <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/guidedtours/sue-johnston\">Sue Johnston</a> or like <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/guidedtours/michelle-ackerley\">Michelle Ackerley </a>who is a children’s TV presenter.
