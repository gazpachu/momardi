I figure, no one is too old in this field especially because it is probably the only platform where people are allowed to aim for limitless possibilities – and so I thought that yeah it´s still a very open industry.</p>\n<p>Well, what do you know? I received multiple slaps of rejection e-mails and it came to a point when it already became monotonously predictable. (Hey Universe, can you surprise me a little bit?)</p>\n<p>Last January, I decided to e-mail <strong>Sir Anthony Caro</strong>, the famed British sculptor, and asked him for a job just the same way he did when he went to Henry Moore´s studio years ago.

In the last 4 months, we have just taken on a full-time P.A and studio coordinator to Sir Anthony. Before we used to have part-time staff and interns but we have now changed our system and only employ one, full time employer in the office.</p>\n<p>I assume you are looking for office work and not fabrication work in the studio? I have heard that Antony Gormley is looking for some office assistants. Perhaps you could contact him?</p>\n<p>I will keep your C.V on file, if anything does come up I will let you know. Best of luck, Pat</p>\n<p>Well, I was floored!</p>\n<p>It was just an email from his studio coordinator but <strong>Mr. Patrick Cunningham</strong> was really gracious enough to answer an email of a fan who´s longing to work with this artist. Imagine having an email mentioning both <strong>Sir Anthony and Antony Gormley</strong>! wooohoo, I was already in the moon.</p>\n<p>The next day, Pach, my hubby woke me up and told me to get dressed. He said, <strong>“we are going to Antony Gormley´s studio today</strong> and we are going to hand in your CV.” When we arrived at Antony´s Camden studio, all I could see was a big towering silver gate and glimpse of the roof of his giant studio. My first reaction was, wow, he´s got a lot of space to work on his stuff. <strong>I made 3 deep breaths before I rang the doorbell.</strong> I was waiting for someone to say something on the other end but there was silence.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/75bd4046f330242f5923bfb63e8ab57d/55fd7/View-of-Event-Horizon-part-of-Antony-Gormley-Blind-Light-at-The-Hayward.-Photo-copyright-Gautier-Deblonde_wipng6.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 32.96875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"View of Event Horizon part of Antony Gormley Blind Light at The Hayward  Photo copyright Gautier Deblonde wipng6\"\n        title=\"View of Event Horizon part of Antony Gormley Blind Light at The Hayward.

Then a beautiful girl in studio clothes opened the door to the studio asked me what was going on and I handed her my CV. Damn she was pretty and so lucky to be working in that studio. She quickly hurried up the external stairs to hand it to someone —- I wished it was Antony but I knew on that fine day he would be working. It was such a thrill that it didn´t matter when I received an email from <strong>Laura Mcnamara</strong>, his assistant:</p>\n<p>Dear Tuesday</p>\n<p>Many thanks for dropping your cv in today.
