Believe me, it’s something I would like to overcome because it doesn’t really serve me well. It doesn’t help that my cheeks get red and my tongue gets tied in front of a famous artist. Do you say ‘I’m your biggest fan’ as your opening line? How would anyone react to that? Instead of embarrassing myself, I just smile, stare and get red in one corner.</p>\n<p>In fact, I recognise that this is a result of <strong>being blinded by the newly celebrity status of artists today</strong>. It should be a conscious effort on my part to separate the ‘celebrity’ out of the artist and focus on how their art is speaking to me. Would I still like their art if they were not famous?

The interior of the house for example is something all of us have ignored just because it is there but Rachel decided it is as important as the house itself.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/momardi/static/5a9e60fcc154683a7fe7c93cc25b36f4/55fd7/rachel-whiteread-holocaust-memorial_wfnqa1.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 77.03125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"rachel whiteread holocaust memorial wfnqa1\"\n        title=\"Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial, 2000 by Rachel Whiteread.
