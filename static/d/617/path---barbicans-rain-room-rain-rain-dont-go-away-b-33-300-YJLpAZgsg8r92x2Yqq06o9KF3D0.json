Thank God I chose to come on a weekday – the queue was considerably long but manageable and I was entertained by listening to the <strong>conversations of young wannabee artists who all came for the promise of a drizzle</strong>.</p>\n<p>I have asked myself why I was even interested to come here in the first place. I’ve grown up and lived in a place where tropical storms and torrential rain are as frequent as having your breakfast. Maybe I do miss it – the drama that a real rain brings (trapped indoors, without any electricity –  I think one can truly be your most creative during stormy weather. You can pen a hundred love songs from your hundred heartbreaks or write a cheesy soap opera with you as the damsel in distress.) <strong>But yes, that kind of rain – the type that can wreak havoc in land and topple down dingy houses unfortunately – can (sometimes) inspire you and be a great companion for melancholic days</strong>. (Of course if it’s devastating like Hurricane Sandy, it’s another matter, but forgive me for romanticising rain in this post).</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 76.5625%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 2em\"\n          >\n            <iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/51830893?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0&amp;color=ffffff\" style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/51830893\">Rain Room at the Barbican, 2012</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/randomvids\">rAndom International</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Rain Room</strong></p>\n<p>Here at the Barbican, I know I’d be seeing simulated rain and I wonder what kind of emotions I can feel coming face to face up-close and personal with an inspiration-ally. Entering the long corridor of the Curve room is in itself an experience as you already hear the sound of heavy rain smashing against the pavement. <strong>It’s almost too cinematic – at the end of the corridor before you turn unto the curve, shadows of the onlookers are projected at a white wall while your own footsteps get diluted in the smell of the looming downpour</strong>.</p>\n<p>Young experimental practice called <a href=\"http://random-international.com/\">Random international</a> really know how to up the game of interaction – although they have been distancing themselves from defining their practice as such and have aligned themselves more in creating architectural settings. Whatever it is, <strong>this 3d installation where you could control torrential rain without getting wet is genius</strong> – and I feel like somehow we’ve tricked nature for once this time. With only eight people allowed to interact with the rain, there’s a guaranteed intimacy with this man-made natural concoction of a downpour.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/momardi/static/53706542198d30237ab65682bcc0c64d/55fd7/rainentrance_dyfez0.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwACBf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAQXjqYij/8QAGhAAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMAAhEEIf/aAAgBAQABBQJPMu1WrrWEegnSwmbP/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAwEBPwE//8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAgEBPwE//8QAHBAAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAEBEhIjFB/9oACAEBAAY/AlLPtvJgUDnqcq//xAAaEAEAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhUTFB/9oACAEBAAE/Ic/VZeFYZ8hWhzMfDyPat7FXP//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQA+//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/ED//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/ED//xAAbEAEAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMUGBwf/aAAgBAQABPxDiMti795LTGlA5BlfYeJqLYlnyw404E+xCbn//2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"rainentrance\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/momardi/static/53706542198d30237ab65682bcc0c64d/55fd7/rainentrance_dyfez0.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/momardi/static/53706542198d30237ab65682bcc0c64d/e81c0/rainentrance_dyfez0.jpg 200w,\n/momardi/static/53706542198d30237ab65682bcc0c64d/8e8ea/rainentrance_dyfez0.jpg 400w,\n/momardi/static/53706542198d30237ab65682bcc0c64d/55fd7/rainentrance_dyfez0.jpg 640w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 2em\"\n          >\n            <iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/50987695?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0&amp;color=ffffff\" style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/50987695\">Rain Room at the Barbican</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/randomvids\">rAndom International</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The experience</strong></p>\n<p>Staged in a rectangular platform, this hundred square metre field of falling water is made more dramatic by being backlit by a glaring spotlight.  People who had been able to jump right in the rain walk about with a glassy and inspired look about them. They don’t get wet as you already know – through the use of sensors, the rain responds to their movement and presence.  What happens next is a sight to behold – the rain envelops them forming a quasi-silhouette while trickling down in other parts of the platform. The dry rain feels real that one man opened his umbrella and posed for a snapshot for his girlfriend.</p>\n<p>The rain room is a a marriage of art, science and technology. When it was my turn to go in the rain, I felt an emotional kind of zen-peace, the kind of feeling that you get when are in touch with nature.  Being surrounded by rain that close with all the symphony of falling water beneath your feet – is a privilege – it almost feels like a miracle.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/momardi/static/6d380225ec8dea522eaa48a1e602baec/55fd7/rain2_de115z.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQBAgMF/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB2pzYHhEP/8QAGBAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECESH/2gAIAQEAAQUCqkVS3UNj3en/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/AT//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/AT//xAAXEAADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAC/9oACAEBAAY/Ah3U/8QAGRABAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIVEQ/9oACAEBAAE/ISNjNQ+Tpd4xpOErif/aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQ1D//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/ED//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/ED//xAAbEAEAAwADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMVFhkf/aAAgBAQABPxAbWDX7FU+anU9hgcKgQl6r5dmBRCitn//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"rain2\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/momardi/static/6d380225ec8dea522eaa48a1e602baec/55fd7/rain2_de115z.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/momardi/static/6d380225ec8dea522eaa48a1e602baec/e81c0/rain2_de115z.jpg 200w,\n/momardi/static/6d380225ec8dea522eaa48a1e602baec/8e8ea/rain2_de115z.jpg 400w,\n/momardi/static/6d380225ec8dea522eaa48a1e602baec/55fd7/rain2_de115z.jpg 640w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Read more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/oct/03/random-international-rain-barbican\">The Guardian: Random international  installs torrential rain in Barbican gallery</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://londonist.com/2012/10/art-review-rain-room-the-curve-barbican-centre.php\">Londonist: Rain Room @Curve in Barbican</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/6/3463754/rain-room-art-installation\">The Verge: Artists create miracle ‘rain room’ keeping you dry in the middle of a shower</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2212275/Contemporary-art-studio-installs-rain-room-let-visitors-experience-realistic-wet-weather--autumnal-LONDON.html\">Daily Mail: Contemporary studio installs ‘rain room’ to let visitors experience realistic wet weather in autumnal London</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/54592/rain-room-lets-visitors-stay-dry-while-passing-through-a-downpour/#.UJAF7WdKRFA\">Architizer: Rain Room lets visitors stay dry while passing through a downpour</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19873953\">BBC News: Barbican’s Rain Room where visitors stay dry</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19827066\">BBC: Staying dry in a room full of rain</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/9579323/Random-International-Rain-Room-The-Curve-Barbican-preview.html\">Telegraph: Random International, Rain Room, Curve, Barbican</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/barbicans-rain-room-rain-rain-dont-go-away/","prefix":"2012-10-30"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rain Room at the Barbican: Rain, Rain, don't go away","category":"exhibits","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/momardi/static/6d380225ec8dea522eaa48a1e602baec/d927d/rain2_de115z.jpg"}}}}},"authornote":{"id":"b6415c02-57f6-5889-8910-a05deb06efca","html":"<p>Article by <strong>Tuesday Gutierrez</strong>.
