When he finally produced a documentary which turned out to be unwatchable, <strong>Banksy</strong> told him he should do a small exhibit while he takes on the editing of the documentary. But obsessive by nature, Thierry came out with a big show, exhibiting art works that merge s<strong>treet art and pop art together</strong>, and that´s when Mr. Brainwash, was born. Mr. Brainwash became an overnight sensation. There is something Forrest Gumpish about this whole thing.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/momardi/static/7a62c94c722025943a1352c017a9b103/58a96/4909047741_6ff7507d13_k3jgwd.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 200px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 150%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"4909047741 6ff7507d13 k3jgwd\"\n        title=\"Madonna at the Mr. Brainwash´Icon show.

I believe if he was otherwise, then it would have been impossible for him to get the trust of these established street artists who allowed him to film them.</p>\n<p><strong>Second, unbeknownst to him, by filming the creative process of these artists, he was learning himself</strong> — which was his alternative to an expensive art education. By befriending these artists especially Banksy, he was unconsciously positioning himself to be one himself. (You know the saying, tell me who your friends are and I´ll tell you who you are?). I also loved the fact that he was not ashamed to do self-marketing.</p>\n<p>He also didn´t pretend that he knew how to do everything and in fact has admitted to employing a staff who would execute things for him. His rise to the top originated as a joke but he himself said that only time can prove whether he is an artist or not. Maybe art already turned out to be a big joke. Maybe Thierry Guetta was not even real. Maybe this movie was just brainwashing us to believe its even a movie. Or maybe, I´m just running out of things to say. But one thing is very clear: I am inspired.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/momardi/static/8b2a4665610fefc91a0ea5ce95249339/55fd7/4836819120_0582e84986_z_qff6jd.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.71875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"4836819120 0582e84986 z qff6jd\"\n        title=\"The Icons by Mr. Brainwash.
