People need to sign up as members to get exclusive deals and access to private deals plus a blog where members can contribute articles. I haven’t signed up yet but thought that it’s about time to have something like Rise Art to touch on getting affordable art to this Facebook  generation. After all, if social media dictates and reflects what the public wants, then why not include art as the last piece of the puzzle? I’ve browsed through some of the artwork featured are really of high-calibre.</p>\n<p>Luckily, I interviewed David Smith from Rise Art. They have just launched their first official partnership with <a href=\"http://www.bloomsbury-art-fair.com/\">Bloomsbury Art Fair </a>from 4 to 8 July. I sent him a few questions to know more about this collaboration.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/640img-Murakami_v736sq-2f88c7738a4dc56c25a47854df8c9806-55fd7.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; null; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"640img Murakami v736sq\"\n        title=\"Murakami\"\n        src=\"/static/640img-Murakami_v736sq-2f88c7738a4dc56c25a47854df8c9806-55fd7.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/640img-Murakami_v736sq-2f88c7738a4dc56c25a47854df8c9806-e81c0.jpg 200w,\n/static/640img-Murakami_v736sq-2f88c7738a4dc56c25a47854df8c9806-8e8ea.jpg 400w,\n/static/640img-Murakami_v736sq-2f88c7738a4dc56c25a47854df8c9806-55fd7.jpg 640w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n  <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Murakami</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n      </p>\n<p><strong>1.

Do you think artists are sticking it out here or London or fleeing somewhere else to do their art.</strong></p>\n<p>I think there is a mixture of both. Some artists really benefit from the collaborative opportunities and the density of art related organizations that are based in the capital. I think the capital is a really great place for those artists at the earlier stages of their careers to be based. For more established artists, I think there is a drift from London, and you can see that now in where most of the YBAs in the 90s are now based.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How did your collaboration with Bloomsbury art fair come about?</strong></p>\n<p>The Bloomsbury Art Fair is a different type of fair. It is fun, accessible, and brings together a very diverse selection of galleries and artists.We wanted to support it, because as a non-profit, they are supporting some great causes as well, including Motivation and the Southern Spinal Injuries Trust. We wanted to support their cause, and make the work sold at the fair available to a wider audience online</p>\n<p><strong>5.
