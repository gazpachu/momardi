To quote loosely, he says what’s really fascinating is that people are producing things that are ‘avant-garde’ which professional photographers do not even dream of doing. </p>\n<p>I’m part of this community of instant snappers – with my Lumix and SLR everywhere I go just to capture pretty much ‘whatever’ without having a care in the world whether the picture is good enough. I am sure there are more gung-ho Instagrammers better than me who are producing more creative and quirky stuff but I still have yet to see photos that haunt, disturb or help us reflect about the world in which we live in.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, the <a href=\"http://www.worldpressphoto.org/2013-photo-contest\">World Press Photo Contest</a> is an anti-thesis of Instagram. <strong>Now showing at the <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/\">Southbank Centre</a> here in London until 27 November</strong>. It provides us with a line-up of the best of photojournalism, all done as a testament to our human history. From child brides, prostitutes to a winning prize photo of a Yemeni mother cradling his son, these are stories that are often overlooked or ignored. We might like our happy-go-lucky Instagram photos to make our day, <strong>but these World Press images force us to look into a reality we often want to escape from.</strong></p>\n<p>Here are the Top 19 images from the World Press Photo Contest:</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/01_Samuel-Aranda_jduf9x-1360cfeb214c4431fdbf4a6452603908-55fd7.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; null; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEAQX/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAP/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABkWjBqOaR/8QAGhAAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAxESFP/aAAgBAQABBQJC7ym3B6YrHk4TP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8BP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8BP//EAB0QAAICAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhEhEDEyQVH/2gAIAQEABj8Cxheji+jiOK2ZKlVaf//EABwQAQABBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAECExQRFRYf/aAAgBAQABPyGxvWvBFd+IgcmCQ46JoQWvT//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQaO//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/ED//xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAESH/2gAIAQIBAT8QmI//xAAbEAEAAwEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAABABExIVFBYf/aAAgBAQABPxBlWggfDJb4Erev6R0APbqLY226dlA2lE57Fb2f/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Samuel Aranda, Spain, for The New York Times\"\n        title=\"Samuel Aranda, Spain, for The New York Times.

Ongoing protests against the 33-year-long regime of authoritarian President Ali Abdullah Saleh escalated that day. Witnesses said that thousands marched down Zubairy Street, a main city thoroughfare, and were fired on when they reached a government checkpoint near the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Some demonstrators retreated, others carried on and were shot at again. At least 12 people were killed and some 30 injured. Ms Qaws—who was herself involved in resistance to the regime—found her son after a second visit to look for him, among the wounded at a mosque that was being used as a temporary field hospital. Zayed remained in a coma for two days after the incident. He was injured on two further occasions, as demonstrations continued. On 23 November, President Saleh flew to Saudi Arabia, and signed an agreement transferring power to his deputy, Abdurabu Mansur Hadi. Saleh’s rule ended formally when Hadi was sworn in as president, following an election, on 25 February 2012.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/02_Vincent-Boisot_kqokmq-4e6ad11a6e4a2cf6bfb9dd1e5a3aa9c4-55fd7.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; null; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEBQb/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABzmU3S80OGf/EABgQAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAxES/9oACAEBAAEFApz6YS00GOiLkECNVcp//8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAh/9oACAEDAQE/AcCf/8QAFhEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAx/9oACAECAQE/AaV//8QAGRAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECETGh/9oACAEBAAY/AtEujRVDiSR//8QAGxAAAwADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERITFhQVH/2gAIAQEAAT8hsxNfRazTc5ODOC1KclMwGtmfLH6j/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABDc/wD/xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARFR/9oACAEDAQE/EFToj//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oACAECAQE/EBX/xAAbEAEAAwEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMUFRYf/aAAgBAQABPxBkLOf0y5kyBZjWpqF9n2oEOa8e/SDpV6a6VWd5KcIUvR2f/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Vincent Boisot, France, Riva Press for Le Figaro Magazine\"\n        title=\"2nd prize Arts and Entertainment Singles.

Entertainers perform in restaurants in the Russian resort city of Sochi, on the eastern coast of the Black Sea. Greater Sochi sprawls for some 145 kilometers along the shoreline, attracting predominantly Russian holidaymakers, who come for the sun, sea, sand, and nightlife. Restaurants are plentiful and competition is fierce. Most provide entertainment. The singers come from all walks of life, and are of all ages. Some perform in one place all year round, others move from restaurant to restaurant during the summer season. They sing a mixture of Russian ballads and pop music, solo or in duos, accompanied on a synthesizer, by recorded music, or sometimes by live instruments.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/04_Brent-Stirton_q6kqfb-45d7fad06d009371d8bd43cfa1d29624-55fd7.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; null; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.71875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Brent Stirton, South Africa, Reportage by Getty Images for Kyiv Post / The Sunday Times Magazine\"\n        title=\"1st prize Contemporary Issues Singles.

The tradition of child marriage spans continents, religion, and class. Girls who marry early often abandon their education. The incidence of maternal and infant death is high for women who give birth under the age of 18. Child marriages often take place in defiance of national laws, and despite education programs about health issues. They are seen as an economic necessity in some regions, or are deeply ingrained in local culture.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/06_Damir-Sagolj_lcpb9e-e249b51c2a3021f4e3c82e6ced112f8e-55fd7.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; null; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.71875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Damir Sagolj, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Reuters\"\n        title=\"1st prize Daily Life Singles.

In 2007, aged 84, Monica was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Marcos looked after her himself, coping with the emotional and physical stress of being a caregiver. In the later stages of Monica’s illness, Marcos had to feed her, pureeing her meals beforehand as she could not chew. During the last year of her life, Monica was bedridden and Marcos had to change her diapers three times daily and help visiting nurses treat her bedsores – activities that took up most of his day. She could barely recognize him, though cuddles and caresses helped her to connect, even if for a few seconds. But Marcos was determined to care for his wife at home. “Tell me where she is going to be better than here,” he said. “I treat her like a princess, here she has everything.” Monica passed away in July 2011.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/08_Alex-Majoli_ckcmyx-ef79f6d947f93027be395936ab74504a-55fd7.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; null; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Alex Majoli, Italy, Magnum Photos for Newsweek\"\n        title=\"1st prize General News Singles.

Since late January, protests against Mubarak’s 30-year-old regime had been held nationwide, with Tahrir Square as an increasingly volatile focal point. Crowds gathering in the square were already celebrating what they thought would be a resignation speech. Following Mubarak’s declaration that he would remain, the number and intensity of demonstrations increased across the country. Eventually, at 18.00 on 11 February, Vice-President Suleiman announced that Mubarak had resigned, handing leadership over to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. In response to demonstrators’ demands, the Supreme Council dissolved parliament and suspended the constitution, declaring that it would hold power for six months, or until elections could be held.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/09_Paolo-Pellegrin_fytl5d-971abc235e0170db69fc39cfb9db25e8-55fd7.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; null; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 37.18749999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Paolo Pellegrin, Italy, Magnum Photos for Zeit Magazin\"\n        title=\"2nd prize General News Stories.

The location falls within the Russkaya Arktika National Park, covering more than 46,000 square kilometers of islands and sea in the Arctic Ocean, one of the largest protected areas in the northern hemisphere. A polar bear’s primary prey is the seal, the blubber satisfying the bear’s enormous energy needs. Bears hunt seals from sea-ice platforms, and also use ice floes to move from place to place. In summer months, when much sea ice melts, polar bears can become stranded, and have to forage for what food they can. Their dependence on sea-ice platforms for food, traveling, and also for breeding, makes polar bears vulnerable to the effects of climate warming.

The park is home to four of the world’s remaining eight northern white rhinos, the world’s most endangered animal. Despite the fact that rhinoceros horn is illegal worldwide, demand is rising steeply as a newly wealthy Asian middle class is able to afford the prized substance, previously the province of the rich. Authorities are often bribed, or turn a blind eye to illegal trade in, and use of rhino horn. Ground rhino horn is used primarily as an anti-fever and anti-toxin medication, in practices that go back centuries. In Vietnam, where a senior government minister has claimed that rhino horn cured his cancer, it sells for €1,865 per 100g to local customers, and for over €6,340 to foreign buyers. With rhinoceros horn worth more than gold, the animals are the target of poachers. South Africa alone lost over 400 rhinos to illegal poaching in 2011. It is estimated there are only 16,000 rhinos left in the world, and the animal faces extinction.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/12_Tomasz-Lazar_hnrux0-a4aee1f902c990ee53d0d8c2555a13cf-55fd7.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; null; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.71875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Tomasz Lazar, Poland\"\n        title=\"2nd prize People in the News Singles.

Stop-and-frisk refers to the New York Police Department practice of detaining and sometimes searching people on the street, when they have not necessarily committed a crime. The police and mayor’s office maintain that this has significantly reduced crime in the city. Opponents argue that the practice victimizes low-income communities and people of color. The October demonstrations against stop-and-frisk attracted support from the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement. Scores of OWS supporters made their way up to Harlem from downtown Manhattan, where they had been protesting against corporate greed, social inequality, and what they saw as the power of major banks and multinationals over the democratic process.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/13_Yasuyoshi-Chiba_bh0v0h-7b8f4b8adb0df2d2bebd3f4fed6335fc-55fd7.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; null; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.71875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Yasuyoshi Chiba, Japan, Agence France-Presse\"\n        title=\"1st prize People in the News Stories.

Harsh working conditions, and the risk of being killed by the Taliban, lead to many leaving the force before their contract ends.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/16_Yuri-Kozyrev_tqi1gk-ba1cec8ea291807772336847ff2f2db1-55fd7.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; null; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Yuri Kozyrev, Russia, Noor Images for Time\"\n        title=\"1st prize Spot News Singles.

The uprising against the regime of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi had grown out of clashes with authorities in the east-Libyan city of Benghazi, in mid-February. Anti-Gaddafi sentiment was strongest in the east of the country, and Benghazi came to be seen as the rebel stronghold. Ras Lanuf had fallen to anti-government forces on 4 March, during their initial advance west, towards the capital Tripoli. After heavy bombardment by land, sea and air, Gaddafi’s forces retook the city on 10 March, and began pushing the rebels back. For some days it appeared that even Benghazi would be retaken. Gaddafi’s counter-advance was halted after NATO planes began bombing Libyan military targets, following a UN resolution on 17 March. Rebel forces began moving west again and by the end of the month had recaptured Ras Lanuf, though they would not permanently occupy the city until late August.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/17_Niclas-Hammarstrom_gu0sq6-503d8e0dfbafeeef76371db061be5c83-55fd7.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; null; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.71875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Niclas Hammarström, Sweden, for Aftonbladet\"\n        title=\"2nd prize Spot News Stories.

On 22 July, Anders Behring Breivik (32) killed 69 people on the small island of Utøya, 40 kilometers northwest of Oslo, in Norway. The shootings formed the second of two sequential attacks, the first being a car-bomb explosion in the government quarter of the capital, which killed eight people and injured 92. The Utøya incident took place less than two hours later. The island is the site of an annual summer camp organized by the youth division of the Norwegian Labor Party. Breivik gained access by posing as a police officer who had come to conduct a routine check following the Oslo bombing. He went on to shoot indiscriminately, killing and injuring people around the island and firing on those who jumped into the water in an attempt to escape.</p>\n<p>Local police did not have a helicopter appropriate for transporting groups of officers, and could not find a suitable boat to reach the island. When anti-terror police arrived from Oslo, they were eventually carried over to Utøya on civilian craft, reaching the island an hour after the first shots had been fired. Breivik was arrested, and later put on terrorist charges for both attacks. Breivik, who admitted carrying out both the bombing and the shooting, had been preparing for the attacks for a number of years, and had distributed a manifesto outlining his extremist beliefs.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/18_Ray-McManus_qencag-5333debe5f157f54cef8ac7a6bc1ce84-55fd7.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; null; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 67.96875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Ray McManus, Ireland, Sportsfile\"\n        title=\"2nd prize Sports Singles.
