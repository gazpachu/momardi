Thank God I chose to come on a weekday – the queue was considerably long but manageable and I was entertained by listening to the <strong>conversations of young wannabee artists who all came for the promise of a drizzle</strong>.</p>\n<p>I have asked myself why I was even interested to come here in the first place. I’ve grown up and lived in a place where tropical storms and torrential rain are as frequent as having your breakfast. Maybe I do miss it – the drama that a real rain brings (trapped indoors, without any electricity –  I think one can truly be your most creative during stormy weather. You can pen a hundred love songs from your hundred heartbreaks or write a cheesy soap opera with you as the damsel in distress.) <strong>But yes, that kind of rain – the type that can wreak havoc in land and topple down dingy houses unfortunately – can (sometimes) inspire you and be a great companion for melancholic days</strong>. (Of course if it’s devastating like Hurricane Sandy, it’s another matter, but forgive me for romanticising rain in this post).</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 76.5625%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/51830893?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0&amp;color=ffffff\" style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/51830893\">Rain Room at the Barbican, 2012</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/randomvids\">rAndom International</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Rain Room</strong></p>\n<p>Here at the Barbican, I know I’d be seeing simulated rain and I wonder what kind of emotions I can feel coming face to face up-close and personal with an inspiration-ally. Entering the long corridor of the Curve room is in itself an experience as you already hear the sound of heavy rain smashing against the pavement.** It’s almost too cinematic  –  at the end of the corridor before you turn unto the curve, shadows of the onlookers are projected at a white wall while your own footsteps get diluted in the smell of the looming downpour**.</p>\n<p>Young experimental practice called <a href=\"http://random-international.com/\">Random international</a> really know how to up the game of interaction – although they have been distancing themselves from defining their practice as such and have aligned themselves more in creating architectural settings. Whatever it is, <strong>this 3d installation where you could control torrential rain without getting wet  is  genius</strong> – and I feel like somehow we’ve tricked nature for once this time. With only eight people allowed to interact with the rain, there’s a guaranteed intimacy with this man-made natural concoction of a downpour.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"./images/rainentrance_dyfez0.jpg\">\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 630px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"rainentrance dyfez0\"\n        title=\"rainentrance\"\n        src=\"/static/53706542198d30237ab65682bcc0c64d/8c020/rainentrance_dyfez0.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/53706542198d30237ab65682bcc0c64d/da4c4/rainentrance_dyfez0.jpg 158w,\n/static/53706542198d30237ab65682bcc0c64d/37caf/rainentrance_dyfez0.jpg 315w,\n/static/53706542198d30237ab65682bcc0c64d/8c020/rainentrance_dyfez0.jpg 630w,\n/static/53706542198d30237ab65682bcc0c64d/ec4bb/rainentrance_dyfez0.jpg 640w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">rainentrance</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n      </a></p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/50987695?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0&amp;color=ffffff\" style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/50987695\">Rain Room at the Barbican</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/randomvids\">rAndom International</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The experience</strong></p>\n<p>Staged in a rectangular platform, this hundred square metre field of falling water is made more dramatic by being backlit by a glaring spotlight.  People who had been able to jump right in the rain walk about with a glassy and inspired look about them. They don’t get wet as you already know – through the use of sensors, the rain responds to their movement and presence.  What happens next is a sight to behold – the rain envelops them forming a quasi-silhouette while trickling down in other parts of the platform. The dry rain feels real that one man opened his umbrella and posed for a snapshot for his girlfriend.</p>\n<p>The rain room is a a marriage of art, science and technology. When it was my turn to go in the rain, I felt an emotional kind of zen-peace, the kind of feeling that you get when are in touch with nature.  Being surrounded by rain that close with all the symphony of falling water beneath your feet – is a privilege – it almost feels like a miracle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"./images/rain2_de115z.jpg\">\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative;
