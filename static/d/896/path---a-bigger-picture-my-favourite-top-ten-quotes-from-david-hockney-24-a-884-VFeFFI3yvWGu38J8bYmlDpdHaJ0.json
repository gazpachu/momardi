All of a sudden, we have our own version of Nadal and Rafa in the limelight of contemporary art. <strong>Controversy or not, it has opened a dialogue about the role of assistants in the creative evolution of an artist</strong>. As for when should it be considered the work of the artist or his assistant is as complicated as defining what or when something becomes art. But in general, for British art, it’s all good – all publicity is good publicity especially because these artists are both English.</p>\n<p>Now before I visit the quasi-retrospective  and write a better review of David’s Yorkshire landscape paintings and Ipad drawings, <strong>I found some favourite quotes from David Hockney, which may not be as controversial as the one above, but still delivers the punch</strong> that makes you think hard about art and why Hockney at 74, is still as relevant as ever.</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 78.90625%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 2em\"\n          >\n            <iframe allowfullscreen class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/uIsiuhq2GS8?wmode=transparent&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;rel=0&amp;theme=dark\" title=\"YouTube video player\" type=\"text/html\" style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<figcaption>Interview with David Hockney’s new exhibition at the RA (Channel 4 News)</figcaption>\n<p><strong>My Favourite Top Ten Quotes from David Hockney</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>On people calling him the greatest British living artist</strong>: “You wouldn’t call Picasso an award-winning artist, would you?

He said photography can never depict heaven or hell…My sister, who is just a bit older than me, she’s a retired district nurse, she’s just gone mad with the digital camera and computer – move anything about; she doesn’t worry about whether it’s authentic or stuff like that – she’s just making pictures.” (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2004/mar/04/photography\">Interview with Jonathan Jones, the Guardian, March 4, 2004)</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>On how to look at nature</strong>: ” When you really look at nature like I have been doing…. I mean really look, then you quickly realise we are just insects, stupid little creatures. And you do get a bit of humility. They chopped down some of the trees I had been drawing. I was angry at first, but you then realise that you have another subject: is it dead, is it not?
