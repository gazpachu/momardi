My primal girl-self cannot grasp what type of adrenaline one gets from hearing the sound of screeching tires and the humming of machines for what I would plainly categorise as a man sport. Since being involved in a minor accident years ago, I had sworn never to drive again. But lo and behold! <strong>Seeing the documentary on Ayrton Senna had made me change my mind. Aside from becoming a fan of the legendary driver and having a newfound respect for Formula One</strong>, I´m no longer afraid to take up driving once again.</p>\n<p><strong>Who would have thought that a film about racing would touch my soul to the core?</strong> But that´s what exactly this film did. Directed by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0438090/\" title=\"Asif Kapadia\">Asif Kapadia</a>, <strong>the film is in itself a breakthrough in documentary filmmaking as it tells the story of Senna through archival footage</strong>, giving us a blow by blow account of the events as if we are breathing it live. No fancy special effects, multiple cameras and fast cuts that would dizzy us into space. Just plain storytelling through the mouth of Senna himself as if he was still with us today.</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 78.90625%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 2em\"\n          >\n            <iframe allowfullscreen class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/sfosF-ZAbR4?wmode=transparent&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;rel=0&amp;theme=dark&amp;feature=channel_video_title\" title=\"YouTube video player\" type=\"text/html\" style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<figcaption>Official Trailer of Senna</figcaption>\n<p>The film on Senna brings light to the life of the three-time world champion driver from his humble karting days until his unfortunate death in San Marino in 1994.

A crying fan said that everything in Brazil was hopeless, but Ayrton was the source of their little joy.</p>\n<p><em>“Sometimes a documentary will unexpectedly grab you by the throat, not giving you a second to breathe. such is the power of this man, and this film.” –Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times</em></p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 78.90625%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 2em\"\n          >\n            <iframe allowfullscreen class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Tto-MI689yQ?wmode=transparent&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;rel=0&amp;theme=dark\" title=\"YouTube video player\" type=\"text/html\" style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<figcaption>Asif Kapadia talks about Senna the movie</figcaption>\n<p>The last time I had been touched by the story of an athlete was during Zinedine Zidane´s state of grace playing during the World Cup 2006 eventhough it was marred by the head-butting incident in the finals. <strong>But Ayrton Senn was much bigger than <a href=\"http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&#x26;no=302940&#x26;rel_no=1\" title=\"Great Zidane\">the Great Zidane</a> simply because he took racing to a philosophical and spiritual dimension</strong>. Deeply religious, Ayrton even mentioned of a time when he knew that he was no longer driving but he was doing it unconsciously – as if he was a spiritual being in tune with his calling.</p>\n<p>I knew what the ending of the movie would be but <strong>it still doesn´t count how much my heart still aches</strong> from remembering this part of the movie where Ayrton hesitated to race, and looked as if he subconsciously knew that he would die. <strong>I read in one of the <a href=\"http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2056023007&#x26;page=10\" title=\"Forum on Senna\">forums</a>, how a cinema full of lads were swallowing hard and crying at this moment in the film.</strong></p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ayrtonsenna1_ntyuaq-0cec720db7245696c3b75ceba2e4e135-c90f9.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative;
